              INFORMATION ABOUT THE MAJOR
              {"\n\n"}The B.S. in Cognitive Sciences is structured to provide students with a challenging introduction to the broad field of Cognitive Sciences that is strongly grounded in theory and an empirical approach emphasizing experimental/computational methods. To ensure an intellectually coherent experience, students in the major are able to choose courses from areas including: (a) Cognitive Neuroscience; (b) Experimental Psychologyâ€“Sensation, Perception, Attention, and Memory; (c) Language Science; and (d) Computational Cognitive Science. In addition, students are required to acquire a background in (a) calculus, (b) statistics, (c) introductory computer programming, and (d) some combination of the natural sciences, logic and philosophy of science, linguistics, or more advanced computer science or mathematics.

              {"\n\n"}The Cognitive Science (B.S.) major prepares students for a research career in cognitive science, focusing on any of the current dominant approaches of the field. The study of cognition can be approached though cognitive neuroscience, behavioral experiments, language science, computational and mathematical modeling, or any combination of those. The major combines strong technical skills with deep knowledge of at least one of these approaches.

              {"\n\n"}NOTE: Students may complete the B.A. in Psychology, the B.S. in Psychology, or B.S. in Cognitive Sciences. You may not double major within the majors offered by the department.

              {"\n\n"}Acquire understanding of the relationship between Cognitive Sciences and Neuroscience

              {"\n\n"}Majors understand and can describe how aspects of mental function relate to activity in the brain.

              {"\n\n"}Interpret and Evaluate Research Results

              {"\n\n"}Majors can evaluate critically and apply to their life and work scientifically-based information available in the media as well as research journals in psychological science.
              {"\n\n"}Majors can explain how research method and design choices constrain the possible inferences from data.
              {"\n\n"}Majors understand the issues surrounding reproducibility and transparency in science

              {"\n\n"}Obtain an in-depth understanding of research methods in Cognitive Sciences
