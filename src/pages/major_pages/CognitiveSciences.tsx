              INFORMATION ABOUT THE MAJOR
              The B.S. in Cognitive Sciences is structured to provide students with a challenging introduction to the broad field of Cognitive Sciences that is strongly grounded in theory and an empirical approach emphasizing experimental/computational methods. To ensure an intellectually coherent experience, students in the major are able to choose courses from areas including: (a) Cognitive Neuroscience; (b) Experimental Psychologyâ€“Sensation, Perception, Attention, and Memory; (c) Language Science; and (d) Computational Cognitive Science. In addition, students are required to acquire a background in (a) calculus, (b) statistics, (c) introductory computer programming, and (d) some combination of the natural sciences, logic and philosophy of science, linguistics, or more advanced computer science or mathematics.

              The Cognitive Science (B.S.) major prepares students for a research career in cognitive science, focusing on any of the current dominant approaches of the field. The study of cognition can be approached though cognitive neuroscience, behavioral experiments, language science, computational and mathematical modeling, or any combination of those. The major combines strong technical skills with deep knowledge of at least one of these approaches.

              NOTE: Students may complete the B.A. in Psychology, the B.S. in Psychology, or B.S. in Cognitive Sciences. You may not double major within the majors offered by the department.

              Acquire a Broad, Multidisciplinary Knowledge of Cognitive Sciences

              Majors can describe important questions, results, and theories in each of the following areas: consciousness, language, learning, memory, perception, and decision making.
              Majors have a foundation in biology, chemistry, physics, and/or mathematics to provide a scientific basis for the multidisciplinary study of cognitive sciences.
              In each of four areas of more intensive study, majors can use theories in those areas to predict, evaluate, or interpret behavior in circumstances such as those they might encounter in their work or daily life.

              Acquire understanding of the relationship between Cognitive Sciences and Neuroscience

              Majors understand and can describe how aspects of mental function relate to activity in the brain.

              Interpret and Evaluate Research Results

              Majors can evaluate critically and apply to their life and work scientifically-based information available in the media as well as research journals in psychological science.
              Majors can explain how research method and design choices constrain the possible inferences from data.
              Majors understand the issues surrounding reproducibility and transparency in science

              Obtain an in-depth understanding of research methods in Cognitive Sciences

              Majors have an understanding of the different research methods used in cognitive sciences including behavioral experiments, psychophysics, neuroscience methods, and mathematical modeling.
              Majors have a mastery of at least one scientific programming language and computational research methods
