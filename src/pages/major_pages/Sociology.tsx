              {"\n\n"}Sociology involves the study of societies and human groups. It examines social conflict and cooperation, inequality and the social organization of families, communities, workplaces and nations. The program at UCI covers the breadth of the discipline while giving students opportunities to conduct independent research, participate in an Honors Program, and to take advantage of departmental opportunities in such areas as business, economy and organizations; diversity and inequality; global and international sociology; and social problems and public policy. All students take basic courses on social institutions, theory and methods. Students then take more specialized courses such as race and ethnicity, social psychology, sociology of gender, or political sociology. Courses are enriched by ongoing faculty research on such topics as the work and family of immigrants to the U.S., economic change in Asia, the relation between women and men in different social classes and ethnic groups, and attitudes on sexual behavior.

              {"\n\n"}In addition to developing studentsâ€™ ability to critically analyze and understand social patterns, the major is relevant to professional careers in education, social work, urban planning, law, business, public health, non-governmental organization, and government service. It also provides training for advanced graduate work in sociology and related fields.

              Sociology studies patterns of relationships among people, how behavior is shaped by these patterns of relationships, and how conflicts and cooperation among groups affect social structure and effect social change. Sociology majors are introduced to the most important ideas, methods, and findings of sociology in the introductory courses, explore basic subareas of sociology in the lower division courses, and pursue specialized study in the upper-division courses.

              {"\n\n"}In research and teaching, the Department's faculty emphasize empirical sociological research in such areas as small groups, organizations, work, art, world systems, gender, family, and social networks.
